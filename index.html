                                <p>Ever lose something, but for the life of you, can't seem to find it even though you know the general area where you lost it? Imagine a robot that can autonomously search that area and look for said object by giving it a description of what it looks like. Well, the first step is making sure the robot knows where it is at any given point in time, knows where it has looked, and where it has yet to look. This project focuses on this latter part by having <a href="https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/">Jackal</a>, (a Clearpth UGV) autonomously navigate and map an unknown area using a frontier exploration algorithm I developed.

								<p>Using computer vision feedback, <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer/" target="blank">Sawyer</a> (a Rethink Robot) navigates a ball through a maze from start to finish.

								<p>A big part of robotics is simulation. Being able to visualize how an object dynamically moves and interacts with its environment helps confirm how it would act in a real life scenario. The best part? Parameters such as initial conditions and external forces can be changed or added in to visualize different situations. This project uses lagrangian dynamics to model how a square prism moves through a Plinko board after being launched from a ramp in both air drag and no air drag environments.</p>

								<p>In today's day and age, Computer Vision is ubiquitous. From video surveillance on VMS software to automatic hand-initiated photo capture on an Android phone. Why not for games too? In this project, your hand becomes your very own pistol! Your goal is to shoot the bouncing ball as many times as you can. Every time you hit the ball, it changes color. But time is short as the ball shrinks in size every time it hits the surrounding walls.

                                <p>Seeing how robots with end effectors move in real life such as for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebX5hU_MDAY" target="blank">automated robotic welding</a> or for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=5sr7TA33jr4" target="blank">handling silicon wafers</a> is cool. But what makes them move the way they do to get from point A to point B? The answer is through robotic manipulation principles that involve joint positions and velocities, rigid body motion, inverse kinematics, and controls. This project demonstrates the use of these principles as well as PI control to get the KUKA youBot end-effector to move to a specified configuration.</p>

The <a href="https://youtu.be/dyrFOO4eVK8?t=49s" target="blank">DJI Phantom Pro</a> is one, and it can take some pretty awesome footage of its target. This is done through computer vision techniques that involve deep learning for classifying and recognizing a target image like you and me. This project, on a much simpler level, uses color segmentation in the HSV space to recognize the red color of the ball. Based on where the centroid of that blob of red color is located in the camera frame, the servos that hold the camera move such that the centroid is always in the center of the camera frame.</p>

Based on interacting with the kids and teachers as well as learning about Autism Spectrum Disorder in class, my team developed a toy that would address the kids' motor, creativity, and problem solving skills while also providing them with sensory feedback.

The Collegiate competition objective was to launch a boosted dart and characterize its rotational motion. The Midwest competition involved launching the same rocket twice with the second launch implementing a drag system such that it reached 75% of the first launch's peak altitude. In both projects, my role involved designing and programming the electronics bay.</p>

As google defines it, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+aquaponics&oq=define+aquaponics&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.3323j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="blank">aquaponics</a> is "a system of aquaulture in which the waste produced by farmed fish or other aquatic animals supplies nutrients for plants grown hydroponically, which in turn purify the water." See the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/13evQzgwYeQWGI/giphy-downsized-large.gif" target="blank">gif</a> for a small-scale animation of this process. My team - the Efficient Aquaponics Sustainability Effort - focused on an indoor multi-room facility in Kenosha, WI called Natural Green Farms (NGF). Our mission was to propose an energy-efficient and cost-effective system which would supplement or replace NGF's current energy supply.

											<p align="left">One of the best feelings in the world is making a difference in society, no matter how small or great. Robotics is a growing field that does just that, be it in space exploration, prosthetics, or self-driving cars. At Northwestern, my main objective is to study autonomous robotics, which involves path planning, AI, computer vision, algorithm design, embedded systems, controls, and a lot of other useful subjects. With technology advancing as quickly as it is, my vision is to help make a difference in any of a variety of fields including (but not limited to) the aerospace, automotive, and/or medical industries. I believe that my creativity, passion for the field, and growing experience will help me get there.</p>
